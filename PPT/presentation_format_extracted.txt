Late  submissions  will  not  be  accepted  and  will  be  disqualified .   
Your  presentation  should  follow  these  guidelines .   You  do  not  need  to  answer  every  sub-question —cover  only  what  is  relevant  to  your  solution.   
 
 1)  The  Problem   
What  real  problem  are  you  solving?   
Example:   
●  What  is  happening  today?   
●  Why  is  it  a  problem?   
●  Who  is  affected?   
2)  Our  Solution   
What  did  you  build?   
Example:   
●  What  the  system  does   
●  One  key  capability   
3)  How  It  Works  (Simple  Flow)

Explain  like  you’re  talking  to  a  non-tech  person   
You  must  explain:   
●  Input  →  Decision  →  Output   
●  No  algorithms,  no  jargon  
 
4)  Proof  It  Works  (15  seconds)   
Evidence   
You  can  show  or  say:   
●  Demo   
●  Test  result   
●  Real  example   
5)  A  Nuance  You  Handled  That  Others  Might  Miss  
What
 
subtle
 
issue
 
did
 
you
 
explicitly
 
design
 
for?
 
 
Examples:   
●  Mixed  language  audio/messages   
●  Over-polite  scam  messages   
●  Human  voices  that  sound  robotic   
●  Repeated  scam  attempts  in  one  session   
6)  A  Trade-Off  You  Made  (and  Why)   
What  did  you  choose  not  to  optimize?   
Examples:   
●  Accuracy  vs  latency

●  Aggressive  detection  vs  safety   
●  Engagement  depth  vs  containment   
7)  A  Failure  Case  You  Can  Explain  Clearly  
Where
 
Does
 
Your
 
System
 
Struggle
 
Today?
 
 
Examples:   ●  Certain  accents   
●  Very  short  conversations   
●  Novel  AI  voice  models
